# Smart Contract

Totle's suite of smart contracts enables developers to build aggregated token exchange with custom allowances and fees.

Once you have deployed your own custom partner contract, simply include your partner contract address in the API's`partnerContract` parameter. 

To learn how to customize the your contracts allowances, visit the [settings section](setting-allowances.md).

{% page-ref page="setting-allowances.md" %}

To generate your own contract with custom fees, [deploy a partner contract](partner-contracts.md).

{% page-ref page="partner-contracts.md" %}

To use a **live version** of Totle's smart contracts, visit [Totle Swap](https://swap.totle.com).
