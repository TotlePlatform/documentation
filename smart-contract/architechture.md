| Smart Contract | Description | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Totle Primary](https://github.com/TotlePlatform/contracts/blob/master/README.md#11-totleprimary) | Responsible for all implementation specific logic required by each DEX | This contract is the sole entry point for external transactions and is responsible for performing sanity checks on the payload, executing trades via the respective exchange handler, and keeping count of amounts given and received in order to enforce minimum exchange rate requirements. |
| [Token Transfer Proxy](https://github.com/TotlePlatform/contracts/blob/master/README.md#12-tokentransferproxy) | Responsible for transferring ownership of ERC20 tokens from the investor to the `TotlePrimary` contract on execution of a sell order | `TokenTransferProxy` is responsible for transferring ownership of ERC20 tokens from the buyer/seller to the **TotlePrimary** contract on execution of a sell order. The buyer/seller is therefore required to set an allowance for the **TokenTransferProxy** prior to selling any tokens via Totle. The **TokenTransferProxy** maintains a record of addresses which have been authorized to transfer tokens on its behalf, the only address with this authorization is the **TotlePrimary** contract. In case of an upgrade to the primary contract, Totle is the only authorized party to approve this change. As the platform matures we may implement a safeguarding mechanism such as a multi-sig or time-locked contract to control address authorization and welcome feedback on this from the community. |
| [Exchange Handler](https://github.com/TotlePlatform/contracts/blob/master/README.md#13-exchangehandler) | Loops through each token trade, sequentially executing all orders at their respective exchange handlers. This contract is entry point for external transactions and performs sanity checks on the payload | Due to the differing requirements of executing trades at each DEX, we employ the use of separate **ExchangeHandler** contracts. An **ExchangeHandler** is responsible for all implementation specific logic required by each DEX. This could range from depositing funds prior to initiating a trade to wrapping or unwrapping ether as required. It is a key requirement that we keep DEX logic separate from the primary contract in order to allow for expansion of the platform. |
